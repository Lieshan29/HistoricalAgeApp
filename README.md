IMAD
Assignment 1

The historical celebrity app assists users in locating celebrities that are similar to themselves in terms of age when they utilise it. This educational software can teach users something new about various historical celebrities that they may not have known. 

Though there are numerous uses for my app, there is one primary one. Finding a celebrity who is roughly your age is the main goal. People can benefit from this in a variety of ways. It can assist individuals in learning about the ages and passing of various celebrities. Additionally, it provides the user with details on the celebrity, including their biography and manner of death.

When developing the application, my goal was to make it as intuitive as possible. Since there are two buttons, I limited the functionalities and buttons to prevent misunderstanding. In order to enhance the experience by allowing them to learn new things while having fun, I also select well-known celebrities who many people may already be familiar with but may not know much more about. Additionally, it might motivate users to want to utilise our software in order to keep learning. 

I put a lot of thought and effort into creating the software, and I went through multiple stages to make sure I achieved my primary goal. I started taking down notes in our IMAD classes and asked for assistance where i needed help. I began by organising my user interface design and determining how to make it suitable for the historical and ancient theme while also being creative and artistic. I came up with the lightly coloured background with the "History" image being displayed. After that, I started thinking of easy methods to make the programme as user-friendly as possible while minimising its complexity. I made use of the age bar and two buttons. The two buttons were easy to locate and were set in bold colours. The age bar was also bold and easy to read.

I changed the fonts' colours and widths to make it the user's most visually appealing. After I had finished all of my user interface designing and detailing, it was time to complete the coding part of this application. I started by reviewing the declarations. After giving my widgets their unique ids, I declared my two buttons, generate and clear button as well as my text view widgets . I had to enter easy ID's that i could remember so that the declarations were easy to make and to limit the amount of errors made . After that, I decided to script and control my buttons using the command setOnClickListener.

 I then began coding out my strings for the various responses and the age variables. After that, I had to start providing age ranges and choose a new celebrity for the app to react to based on the user's age. To make the experience more thrilling, I divided the code into ranges of ten and distributed it to well-known celebrities that some people might recognise. In order to provide further context for the encounter, I also included the celebrity's fame along with their name. While doing so, I gradually put my if and else statements into practice to increase the application's responsiveness and level of sophistication. I had to use my if and else clauses precisely. 

Finally, I fixed all of the bracket spacing issues and cleaned up all of the mistakes in my code. This is where I discovered most of my mistakes such as incorrect ID's being used by the declarations and random brackets that started and ended in incorrect places.

Finally it was time to run the app and see whether everything was in working order. unfortunately, after the first run, the app opened but was unable to generate information after input was applied. I then went back to my code where I discovered that there were errors in the code of my user interface. I then corrected the errors and the app ran succesfully.

This app cause quite a few difficulties my way. To aid myself, I resolved to using Google and other forms of help such as YouTube. I used YouTube videos from YouTube channels such as "Tech Raj". I went to YouTube when I found difficulties in the if and else statements. When I came across more difficulties, I looked towards outside in person help. A few of my class mates who already had their app running and in working condition were at great help to me as they assisted me in getting my code in order and ready to run. I found this easier than resolving to YouTube videos and websites because it was in person help and they knew exactly what to do and how to do it in the correct context. This was because many people believed that ai technology was 
GitHub played a massive part in the making of my application. From the moment I started the creation of my app, I referred to GitHub for everything. GitHub is an application that provides you a wide range of developer tools that can greatly help you in creating and making software and applications. It helps you track your progress and identifies your errors for you. It recommends ways form you to correct your errors. GitHub helps you keep all your work in an organized condition while working with your project. While doing my application, every time I was done with my work for a day, I saved my progress on GitHub. I not only used GitHub to store my code and use it to correct my errors but I also used it as a way to learn. I referred to many similar examples on GitHub to guide my code since I am a beginner in GitHub was also helpful because I was able to work on different projects simultaneously. GitHub provided me with all types of assistance and wasn't short in giving me responses. I managed to get help from different computer experts on the application and all the assistance contributed to the success of my application.

Overall, I think my application is a success. It is an app that any student can gain information from that they probably did not even know about themselves. It did take much effort but with all the external assistance and research conveyed, I managed to get the app running and operating. I hope my app finds great use to it’s users as much time and effort was put into getting the app in running condition. I hope the users are able to gain useful and interesting information.
